Processing API
Overview
Below, you can find a list of all supported Processing Engine conversions. Please refer to Processing Engine Overiew for more information about this system.

Security
If your account has security enabled, a valid policy and signature will be required for any and all processing requests. The processing engine accepts security parameters as a URL task:

https://cdn.filestackcontent.com /security=p:POLICY,s:SIGNATURE/ HANDLE
Please see our security documentation for more information regarding the generation of policies and signatures.

Legend
All task parameters listed here follow this pattern. Array types are presented as ordered lists of their respective types. Required fields are marked by an asterisk *.

Name (Alias)	parameter type default value
Control Tasks
Cache
cache=expiry:3600

Specify the amount of time for how long the file should be cached in our CDN. For example, cache=expiry:31536000 will set the cache duration for 1 year. You can also use cache=expiry:max and the same value will be set for the cache headers: “Cache-Control:public, max-age=31536000”. The cache can be set to false to ensure that you always receive a newly converted file. This setting is only recommended for testing purposes because every time a URL using cache=false loads, it will count against your conversion quota.

Parameters

false (f)	boolean
expiry (e)	integer
Store
store

Store the result of this transformation into your storage. By default, transformations are stored in temporary storage and cached for 30 days. Storing files can ensure that you don’t incur extra transformations when the cache expires every 30 days. It also allows you to create new handles from transformed URLs.

A request to a URL that contains this task will return a JSON response. Example:

https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/<apikey>/store/<url>
Returns:

{
  "container": "my-bucket",
  "filename": "272262.png",
  "key": "brPb11lRQR67XKxC9aUQ-272262.png",
  "size": 4585441,
  "type": "image/png",
  "url": "https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/feAWPKHgR6SnJMRzsKVP"
}
Store task is capable of triggering workflow jobs. In order to execute a job on a stored file, you’ll need to pass an ID of a workflow you wish to trigger using the workflows parameter. Store task will respond with unique IDs of executed jobs. Example:

https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/<apikey>/store=workflows:["46c8344b-d737-4411-8cbc-edbf66ce6731","448d6764-6ba5-11eb-9439-0242ac130002"]/<url>
Returns:

{
  "container": "my-bucket",
  "filename": "272262.png",
  "key": "brPb11lRQR67XKxC9aUQ-272262.png",
  "size": 4585441,

Fallback
fallback=file:<file>,cache:<cache>

Returns default file if the source of the transformation does not work or the transformation fails.

PARAMETER	VALUE
file	Either handle or URL of the file that should be returned if the transformation source does not work.
cache	Number of seconds fallback response should be cached in CDN.
If you are using a fallback handle that belongs to a different application than the one which runs transformation and it is secured with security policy, appropriate signature and policy with read call should be used:

/fallback=file:"<source>?policy=<policy>&signature=<signature>",cache:10/

You can read more about security policies here.

Examples

The maximum accepted image resolution is 100,000,000 pixels. For example, it can either be 10,000px x 10,000px or 5,000px x 20,000px.

Filestack will also not convert an image that is larger than 256 MB. Please contact us if you require the ability to process larger files.

Image Transformations
Image Size
imagesize

You can use the imagesize task to get information about the width and height of the given image, for example:

https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/imagesize/HANDLE
Imagesize GET request will return data as JSON, for example:

{"height":1253,"width":1080}
Resize
resize=height:200

The resizing feature comprises two main functions: manipulating the width and height of an image and changing the fit and alignment of the image. Either width or height is required. When both width and height are provided, the possible methods by which the image should fit these are:

clip – preserving the aspect ratio, resize the image to be as large as possible while ensuring its dimensions are less than or equal to both those specified
crop – preserving the aspect ratio, ensure the image covers both provided dimensions by clipping/cropping to fit
max – do not enlarge if the dimensions of the provided image are already less than the specified width or height
scale – ignore the aspect ratio of the provided image and stretch to both provided dimensions
If a single dimension is provided, only clip (default) or max fit can be applied.

Resize also allows specifying a resampling filter. Available filters are:

catrom – Catmull-Rom spline
lanczos2 – Lanczos kernel with a=2
lanczos3 – Lanczos kernel with a=3 (default)
mitchell – Mitchell-Netravali spline
nearest – Nearest-neighbour interpolation
Parameters

width* (w)	integer (1 – 10000)
height* (h)	integer (1 – 10000)
fit (f)	one of:
“clip” “crop” “scale” “max”
align (a)	one of:
“top” “bottom” “left” “right” “faces” “center”
or
array of 2 strings:
one of:
“top” “bottom”
one of:
“left” “right”
filter (ft)	one of:
“catrom” “lanczos2” “lanczos3” “mitchell” “nearest”
Crop
crop=dim:[x,y,width,height]

Crop images by entering coordinates and crop dimensions. The X and Y coordinates start from [0,0] and correspond to the top left-hand corner of the image. The width and height parameters dictate the size in pixels of the cropping rectangle. If the crop area extends outside the frame of the image, you will only receive back the part of the image that is within the crop area.

Parameters

dim* (d)	array of 4 integers:
xinteger (0 – 100000)
yinteger (0 – 100000)
widthinteger (1 – 100000)
heightinteger (1 – 100000)
Smart Crop
smart_crop

Smart Crop allows you to programmatically manipulate your images in a way that provides a version of the image that is exactly the shape you want, while keeping it’s aspect ratio and cutting out least interesting fragments of the input picture.

This is a premium feature. Please contact our Support Team.

PARAMETER	VALUE	OPTIONS	DESCRIPTION
mode	string
auto	face object auto	When face value is used we will run face detection on the input image in order to provide the best results if the faces are present. You can specify the mode:object,object: to crop the image against particular object, for example dog.
width*	integer (1-10000)		Width of the output image.
height*	integer (1-10000)		One of:Height of the output image.
fill_color	string		You can specify the color for the bars that appears when the file is cropped. You can use the colors listed in our Color Options
coords	booleanfalse	true false	If true, this task will return JSON object with the coordinates of the cropped area.

Rotate
rotate=deg:180

You can rotate your image in a range clockwise from 0 degrees (no rotation) to 359 (nearly all the way around). Specifying “exif” for the degree parameter will auto-detect EXIF orientation and apply the rotation.

Parameters

deg (d)	one of:
“exif”
or
integer (0 – 359)
exif (e)	boolean
background (b)	color “FFFFFFFF”
Flip
flip

This task flips the image in the vertical direction. Flip requires no additional parameters.

Flop
flop

This task flops the image in the horizontal direction. Flop requires no additional parameters.

Watermark
watermark=position:[middle, center]

You can add watermarks by overlaying one image on top of another. The size of the overlayed image is a percentage of its original size.

Parameters

file* (f)	url_handle
size (s)	integer (0 – 500)
position (p)	one of:
“top” “middle” “bottom” “left” “center” “right”
or
array of 2 strings:
one of:

one of:
“left” “center” “right”
Compress
compress

Filestack offers a standalone task specifically for compression. It utilizes mozjpeg to offer improved compression for JPG files over the algorithm used for output=compress:true. It will not attempt to re-compress a previously compressed image. Compress will only work with PNG and JPG files. If any other format is passed in, it will return an unchanged image. For the best results, compress should be the last task in your transformation chain.

Parameters

metadata (m)	boolean false
Progressive JPEG
pjpg

Convert an image to progressive JPEG. This is ideal for large images that will be displayed while downloading over a slow connection, allowing a reasonable preview after receiving only a portion of the data. However, support for progressive JPEGs is not universal. When progressive JPEGs are received by programs that do not support them (such as versions of Internet Explorer before Windows 7) the software displays the image only after it has been completely downloaded.

Parameters

quality (q)	integer (0 – 100)
metadata (m)	boolean false
Quality
quality

Set the quality of your JPG or WEBP images without the danger of possibly generating a larger file. This is great for reducing the file size of your image before running it through the compress task. Quality is a standalone task which is separate from the quality parameter available in the output task, and it will never increase the size of a file.

Parameters

value* (v)	integer (1 – 100)
Strip Metadata
no_metadata

Remove any embedded metadata from an image file.

Image Enhancements
These powerful image enhancements are available as plugins in our marketplace and in our Transformations UI.

Upscale
upscale

Upscale is available in our marketplace and in our Transformations UI.

Parameters

noise (n)	one of:
“none” “low” “medium” “high”
upscale (u)	boolean true
style (s)	one of:
“artwork” “photo”
Enhance
enhance

Enhance is available in our marketplace and in our Transformations UI.

This task smartly analyzes a photo and performs color correction and other enhancements to improve the overall quality of the image.

Automatic image enhancement
https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/enhance/HANDLE
In standard version enhance requires no additional parameters. If you have presets enabled in your plan you will have access to additional preset parameter.

enhance=preset:<preset>

Available presets are listed in the table below:

PRESET	DESCRIPTION
auto	This parameter automatically chooses a preset that does best enhancement to a photo.
vivid	This preset gives more depth and brightness to a photo.
cache	This preset works wonders on portraits and shots of people. It automatically scans each face in the photo and adjusts how much corrections to apply to each face.
beautify_plus	It is similar to beautify, but it applies stronger corrections and uses larger set of possible modifications.
fix_dark	This setting will do a terrific job on extremely underexposed photos or photos where a dark subject is in front of a very bright background. By turning off the contrast, maximum detail is retrieved from the shadow areas without blowing out the bright areas.
fix_noise	This setting automatically detects noise, and if detected, applies powerful noise removal to remove any grains from your photos while preserving details. Noise is automatically detected and applied depending on the ISO level and your camera make/model, and will therefore vary per photo.
fix_tint	Use this setting to remove abnormal tint (yellow, blue, green, etc.) from your photos. Abnormal tint occurs where the camera’s sensor picked up excess green from fluorescent lights, or excess red from the infrared heat of a person in the image, or excess blue from ultraviolet, or excess yellow from tungsten lights.
outdoor	This preset optimizes your landscape photographs with more color vibrancy. The contrast is adjusted to reveal slightly more detail in the shadow areas.
fireworks	This preset applies correction for dark night sky and sets off excess colors from fireworks.

Facial Detection
Detect Faces
detect_faces

The minsize and maxsize parameters are used to weed out objects that most likely are not faces. This can be an integer or a float in a range from 0.01 to 10000. The default value is 0.35. If the value is larger than 1, it is used as the expected minimum/maximum size of face objects in pixels. So for example if the value is set to 200, then the smallest/largest face object it will detect is 200×200 pixels. If the value that is set is less than 1, e.g. 0.3, then it filters out all face objects it detects that are smaller/larger than the middle/average object size by 30%.

For example, this means that if a set of 3 objects are detected that are (size in pixels) [‘100×100’, ‘200×200’, ‘300×300’], then setting minsize to 0.3 will result in a calculation where the middle object size 200 is used: 200-0.30*200=140 and all objects smaller than 140×140 would be eliminated.

Setting export:true will export all face objects to a JSON object:

[
    {
        "x": 642,
        "y": 298,
        "width": 137,
        "height": 137,
        "id": 1
    },
    {
        "x": 446,
        "y": 731,
        "width": 138,
        "height": 138,
        "id": 2
    }
]
Parameters

maxsize (x)	float (0 – 10000) 0.35
minsize (n)	float (0 – 10000) 0.35
color (c)	color “#000000FF”
export (e)	boolean
Crop Faces
crop_faces

mode:thumb – adds a buffer around the face object by default. Part of the image inside the buffer is always resized to the desired dimensions (w & h parameters).
mode:crop – ignores the buffer around the face object.
mode:fill – works in a similar manner to thumb mode, except that while thumb mode will always crop an image to fit in the whole face object while still trying to respect width and height transformations, fill mode will prioritze width and height parameters over displaying the whole face object.
The faces parameter can be a single face object, an array of face objects, or you can use faces:all to choose all the detected face objects. This parameter governs the faces you want included in your crop.

Parameters

width (w)	integer (1 – 10000)
height (h)	integer (1 – 10000)

Convert file to PDF using our Advanced Conversion Engine:
https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/output=f:pdf,engine:auto/HANDLE
Auto Image Conversion
auto_image

This task automatically changes the encoding of the image based on the user agent and therefore provides better compression and quality characteristics compared to their older JPEG and PNG counterparts.

Currently, Filestack supports automatic conversion to WebP and JPEG XR.

WebP is natively supported in Google Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Opera, and by many other tools and software libraries.

For example this 1.42 MB JPEG image, after applying resize and compress tasks would have 48.45 KB:


https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/resize=w:300/compress/wSPGjTiQtuImifba6aAQ

JPEG 48.45 KB

If you are using auto_image task and one of the supported browsers you should see that it’s delivered in a WebP format and it’s size is 44.84 KB.


https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/resize=w:300/auto_image/compress/wSPGjTiQtuImifba6aAQ

WebP 44.84 KB

Collage
collage=files:[0ZgN5BtJTfmI1O3Rxhce]

The collage task accepts an array of Filestack file handles, storage aliases, or external urls. These files are appended in order to the base file of the transformation URL. Altogther the base image and the passed files are the images that will comprise the collage. The order in which they appear in the array dictates how the images will be arranged.

Both width and height are required. The images passed to this task will be resized using fit:clip (resize) so that the output image is close to the specified dimension parameters. The width parameter takes precedence over the height parameter.

Parameters

files* (f)	array of handles
margin (m)	integer (1 – 100) 10
width* (w)	integer (1 – 10000)
height* (h)	integer (1 – 10000)

Lets assume that your document has 6 pages. When you run /doc_to_images/ task like this:

http://cdn.filestackcontent.com/doc_to_images/handle
You will receive application/json response with the ordered list of image URLs.

[
  "http://cdn.filestackcontent.com/doc_to_images@1/handle",
  "http://cdn.filestackcontent.com/doc_to_images@2/handle",
  "http://cdn.filestackcontent.com/doc_to_images@3/handle",
